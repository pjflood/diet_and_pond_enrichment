# diet_and_pond_enrichment

This repository has code and associated files that examine food-web dynamics from multiple habitats and time points in Everglades National Park. The code supports multiple publications (listed below) and manuscripts in review. The primary focus of this research was to quantify effects of species invasion on Everglades aquatic foods between pre- and post-invasion and effects of alligator engineering of deep-water habitats (ponds) on trophic dynamics. This repository may be developed further in the future to contain additional analyses with these data. Code files should be performed in the numeric order indicated in file names (e.g., 01, 02, 03... etc). Any new code added to the repsotiory will be designed to run after existing code.
